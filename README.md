# The journey
The user had the pleasure of being able to experience the login, register and home Gui forms. They were greeted by the register form and if you'd already registered, you're able to move to the home form

# How it works

By using the 2nd Tier in terms of implementation, I was able to use a combination of interface and class files for every controller and use the Get functions to successfully connect the classes to each other.
